## Contributing
Obviously, contributions of any nature are always welcome. In case it is a bugfix or a small QOL improvement just open a pull request. However, if you are planning on introducing a completely new feature, please open a new issue describing the changes you are planning to introduce first. This allows for better coordination and gives the community an opportunity to provide initial feedback on the idea.
